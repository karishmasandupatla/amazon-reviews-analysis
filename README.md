**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Amazon product reviews using Python to uncover patterns, trends, and customer sentiment insights.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory analysis on Amazon review data  
- Discover rating distributions and review behavior patterns  
- Visualize key insights from customer feedback  

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Managing missing values and duplicate entries  
- Handling unstructured review text  
- Lack of predefined sentiment labels  

---

### ✅ What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (duplicates, null values)  
- Explored rating trends, review lengths, and basic sentiment signals  
- Created visualizations: bar charts, histograms, word clouds, frequency plots  
- Utilized **pandas**, **NumPy**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** for analysis  
- Exported the cleaned dataset for further NLP or ML tasks  

---

### 📁 Tools & Platform
- **Python**  
- **pandas**, **NumPy**  
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**  
- **Google Colab** (platform for running and sharing notebooks)

---

### 📊 Dataset Details
- Sourced from a public Kaggle dataset of Amazon product reviews  
- Features include: `reviewText`, `rating`, `productTitle`, `category`, etc.  

---

### 📌 Outcome
This analysis provides valuable insights into how customers perceive products through reviews and ratings.  
It lays the groundwork for future sentiment classification models, dashboards, and NLP applications.
